# The Chronicles of Robin

### Tech Stack
- **JavaScript:** The main programming language used for the game.
- **React Native:** A framework used for developing the game's mobile application.
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment used to build the game's API.
- **Mongoose:** An Object-Document Mapping (ODM) library used to interact with MongoDB and manage data for the game's API.
- **Uploadcare CDN:** A cloud file storage and delivery service used for storing and distributing files within the game.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used to store and manage data for the game's API.
- **Vercel:** A server provider used for hosting the game's API.

### Goal 
The project aims to develop a mobile game template in a text-based, choose-your-own-adventure format. The primary goal is to facilitate the creation of multiple distinct games with different narratives by making modifications solely to the database and CDN assets. This framework allows for the efficient development of a diverse range of games centered around various storylines.
